I have a good news to share: my project *Probing Chiral Dynamics on Femtosecond Timescales* has been supported by the Institutional Research Support - Dagmar Procházková Fund at University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague. Through this support, I will be able to set up a new research group at the Department of Physical Chemistry there. Looking forward to the adventure!
