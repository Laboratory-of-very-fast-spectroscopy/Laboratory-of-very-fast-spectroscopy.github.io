Another interview with me has been published in the latest issue of SPIN, the internal magazine of UCT Prague (in Czech only). The article is called *I am looking forward to Czech inoffensiveness and directness!* (Těším se na českou neurazitelnost a přímočarost!). Make some tea or coffee, sit down, and enjoy!
