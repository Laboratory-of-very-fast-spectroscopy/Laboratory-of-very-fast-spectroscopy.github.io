Ing. Vít Svoboda, Dr. sc. ETH Zurich
From 2007 he worked at the J. Heyrovský Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in the Department of Molecular and Cluster Dynamics under the leadership of Dr. Ondřej Votavy. Between 2007 and 2010, he completed an internship there as part of his studies at the Masaryk High School of Chemistry in Prague and continued his research work there during his university studies. He devoted himself to highly resolved overtone spectroscopy in supersonic expansions and theoretical interpretation of the measured spectra. From 2010, he studied at University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague, first in the prestigious bachelor's programme in Chemistry, then in the master's programme in Physical Chemistry. For his diploma thesis, he obtained the 2015 Werner von Siemens Award together with Dr. Votava.

The same year he moved to Switzerland to ETH Zürich. There, he worked in the Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Attosecond Science group on his doctorate, the topic of which was time-resolved phenomena in molecules using "low-order harmonic generation".

After his first postdoctoral project at ETH Zürich and a research internship at the Max-Born Institute in Berlin, he decided to taste science "across the pond". From 2022, he was working as a postdoctoral researcher at the JILA Institute in Colorado, where he focused on attosecond processes in plasmonic nanoparticles and chiral structures. At the beginning of 2024, he is returning to the Czech Republic, specifically to the Institute of Physical Chemistry of UCT Prague, where he will establish a new scientific group devoted to the study of the dynamics of chiral molecules.
