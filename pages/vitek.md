## About

From 2007 I worked at the J. Heyrovský Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in the Department of Molecular and Cluster Dynamics under the leadership of Dr. Ondřej Votavy. Between 2007 and 2010, I completed an internship there as part of his studies at the Masaryk High School of Chemistry in Prague and continued research work there during university studies. I devoted the work to highly resolved overtone spectroscopy in supersonic expansions and theoretical interpretation of the measured spectra.

From 2010, I studied at the University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague, first in the prestigious bachelor's programme in Chemistry, then in the master's programme in Physical Chemistry. For my diploma thesis, I obtained the 2015 Werner von Siemens Award together with Dr. Votava.

The same year I moved to Switzerland to ETH Zürich. There, I worked in the Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Attosecond Science group on my doctorate, the topic of which was time-resolved phenomena in molecules using "low-order harmonic generation".

After the first postdoctoral project at ETH Zürich and a research internship at the Max-Born Institute in Berlin, I decided to taste science "across the pond". From 2022, I was working as a postdoctoral researcher at the JILA Institute in Colorado, where I focused on attosecond processes in plasmonic nanoparticles and chiral structures. At the beginning of 2024, I am returning to the Czech Republic, specifically to the Institute of Physical Chemistry of UCT Prague, where I will establish a new scientific group devoted to the study of the dynamics of chiral molecules.
