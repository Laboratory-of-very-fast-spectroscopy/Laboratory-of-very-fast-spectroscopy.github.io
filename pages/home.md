Welcome to the VFS Lab, please look around! The group is led by [Dr. Vit Svoboda]({{ '/people/vit-svoboda' | relative_url }}).

We are interested in **very fast spectroscopy** (sometimes called ultrafast) and attosecond science, specifically in femtochirality, a new fast-growing research field with many potential applications in chemistry and biology, such as chiral recognition and analysis of complex chiral samples, real time monitoring of chiral reactions, or even chiral quantum computing.
